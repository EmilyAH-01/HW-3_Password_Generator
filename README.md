# password-generator

## Summary
This application generates a random password based on the user's input to four prompts: password length, lowercase characters (Y/N), uppercase characters (Y/N), and special characters (Y/N). If no characters are selected, the program defaults to lowercase characters only. Only password lengths between 8 and 128 characters are allowed. 

This app runs in a browser, is mobile-responsive, and uses JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML.
